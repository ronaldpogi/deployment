### 🔹 GitHub Actions + Docker + EC2

* You’re managing raw EC2 instances yourself.

* EC2 is basically just a Linux VM → it comes empty.

* To run Dockerized apps, you must install everything manually:

* SSH into EC2

* Install Docker, Docker Compose, maybe even Nginx

* Configure security groups, IAM, volumes, etc.

* GitHub Actions pushes the image → then you SSH again and run docker pull + docker run.

* You are the orchestrator — you handle scaling, updates, failures.

### 🔹 CodePipeline + CodeBuild + ECR + ECS

* You let AWS manage the container lifecycle.

* Docker is already handled:

* CodeBuild builds the image → Docker is available in its environment

* ECS (Fargate or ECS AMI) runs containers → Docker/container runtime is preinstalled

* No SSH, no manual setup.

* ECS service ensures:

* Auto-restart if a container crashes

* Load balancing across multiple tasks

* Zero-downtime deployments

* AWS is the orchestrator — you just define configuration.

### ✅ Main difference:

* GitHub Actions + EC2 → “DIY” (you manage the server).

* AWS ECS pipeline → “Managed” (AWS handles the server/container runtime).
